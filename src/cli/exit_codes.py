CLI Exit Codes

Standardized exit codes for the repository reporting system CLI.
This module defines exit codes that follow Unix conventions and provide
clear signals for both interactive and automated (CI/CD) usage.

Exit Codes:
    0 - SUCCESS: Operation completed successfully
    1 - ERROR: General error (configuration, API failure, etc.)
    2 - PARTIAL: Partial success (warnings, incomplete data)
    3 - USAGE_ERROR: Invalid arguments or usage
    4 - SYSTEM_ERROR: System-level error (permissions, disk space)

Phase 9: CLI & UX Improvements
