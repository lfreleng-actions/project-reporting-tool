"""
Jenkins job allocation context for thread-safe job tracking.

This module provides a thread-safe context for managing Jenkins job allocation
across concurrent repository analysis operations. It replaces the previous
global lock approach with instance-level isolation.

Thread Safety:
    All public methods are thread-safe and can be called from multiple threads
    concurrently. An internal lock protects all shared mutable state.

Example:
    >>> context = JenkinsAllocationContext()
    >>> jobs = context.get_cached_jobs("my-repo")
    >>> if jobs is None:
    >>>     jobs = fetch_jobs_from_api()
    >>>     allocated = context.allocate_jobs("my-repo", jobs)
    >>>     context.cache_jobs("my-repo", allocated)

class JenkinsAllocationContext:
    """
    Thread-safe context for Jenkins job allocation within a single collection run.

    This class manages the allocation of Jenkins jobs to repositories, ensuring
    that each job is assigned to at most one repository (preventing duplicates).
    It also provides caching to avoid redundant API calls.

    Thread Safety:
        All public methods acquire an internal lock before accessing shared state.
        Multiple threads can safely call methods on the same instance.

    Attributes:
        allocated_jobs: Set of job names that have been allocated to repositories
        job_cache: Cached job data per repository name
        all_jobs: All jobs fetched from Jenkins (cached once)
