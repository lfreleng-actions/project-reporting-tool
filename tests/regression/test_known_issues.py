Regression Tests for Known Issues

These tests prevent previously fixed bugs from reoccurring. Each test
documents a specific issue that was discovered and fixed, ensuring that
future changes don't reintroduce the same problem.

Test Categories:
- Data validation bugs
- Edge case handling
- Serialization issues
- Aggregation bugs
- CLI argument parsing
