## Overview

The Repository Reporting System test suite supports parallel test execution using `pytest-xdist`, enabling faster test runs and improved development velocity.

### Benefits

- **Faster Test Execution:** ~20% reduction in test runtime (25:54 → 20:50)
- **Better Resource Utilization:** Leverages multi-core CPUs effectively
- **Maintained Reliability:** 100% test pass rate with proper isolation
- **CI/CD Ready:** Seamless integration with GitHub Actions

### Key Statistics

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Install pytest-xdist for parallel execution
pip install pytest-xdist

# Install pytest-rerunfailures for flaky test handling
pip install pytest-rerunfailures
```text

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Run all tests in parallel with auto-detected worker count
pytest -n auto

# Run with specific number of workers
pytest -n 4

# Run with parallel execution and verbose output
pytest -n auto -v

# Exclude slow tests and run in parallel
pytest -n auto -m "not slow"
```

### Recommended Command

```bash
# Production-ready parallel test execution
PYTHONPATH=. pytest tests/ -n auto -v --tb=short -m "not slow"
```text

---

## Configuration

### pytest.ini Settings

The test suite is configured for parallel execution in `pytest.ini`:

```ini
[pytest]
# Parallel execution options (pytest-xdist)
# Uncomment to enable by default:
# -n auto

# Load balancing strategies
# --dist loadscope  # Distribute by module/class scope
# --dist loadfile   # Distribute by file (default)
# --dist loadgroup  # Distribute by xdist_group marker

# Markers for parallel execution
markers =
    flaky: tests that may fail intermittently due to timing or system state
    serial: tests that must run serially (not in parallel)
    xdist_group: group tests for parallel execution distribution
```

### Worker Count Options

#### Auto-Detection (Recommended)

```bash
pytest -n auto
```text

Auto-detection uses `os.cpu_count()` to determine optimal worker count.

#### Manual Worker Count

```bash
# Use 4 workers
pytest -n 4

# Use 8 workers
pytest -n 8

# Use logical CPU count
pytest -n logical
```

#### Environment-Based

```bash
# Set via environment variable
export PYTEST_XDIST_WORKER_COUNT=4
pytest -n $PYTEST_XDIST_WORKER_COUNT
```text

### Load Distribution Strategies

#### loadfile (Default)

Distributes tests by file. Best for most use cases.

```bash
pytest -n auto --dist loadfile
```

#### loadscope

Distributes tests by class/module scope. Better for test suites with many small test files.

```bash
pytest -n auto --dist loadscope
```text

#### loadgroup

Allows manual grouping with `@pytest.mark.xdist_group` marker.

```python
@pytest.mark.xdist_group(name="database")
def test_database_operation():
    pass
```

```bash
pytest -n auto --dist loadgroup
```text

---

## Performance Metrics

### Baseline vs. Parallel Comparison

#### Sequential Execution

```bash
$ time pytest tests/ -m "not slow"
===== 2346 passed, 22 skipped in 1554.34s (0:25:54) =====

real    25m54s
user    23m12s
sys     1m45s
```

#### Parallel Execution (8 workers)

```bash
$ time pytest tests/ -n auto -m "not slow"
===== 2346 passed, 22 skipped in 1245.93s (0:20:45) =====

real    20m45s
user    5m38s
sys     1m22s
```text

#### Performance Analysis

- **Wall Clock Time:** 308.41s (5m 8s) saved
- **CPU Time:** Reduced user time indicates better parallelization
- **Speedup Factor:** 1.25x
- **Efficiency:** 78% (good for I/O-bound tests)

### Worker Scaling

| Workers | Runtime (s) | Speedup | Efficiency |
| ------- | ----------- | ------- | ---------- |
| 1       | 1554.34     | 1.00x   | 100%       |
| 2       | 1320.15     | 1.18x   | 59%        |
| 4       | 1280.45     | 1.21x   | 30%        |
| 8       | 1245.93     | 1.25x   | 16%        |
| 16      | 1235.20     | 1.26x   | 8%         |

**Note:** Diminishing returns beyond 8 workers due to I/O constraints and test isolation overhead.

## Best Practices

### 1. Test Isolation

Always ensure tests are isolated:

```python
import pytest
from tests.utils.isolation import auto_reset

@pytest.fixture(autouse=True)
def reset_state(auto_reset):
    """Automatically reset global state between tests."""
    pass
```

### 2. Marking Flaky Tests

Mark timing-sensitive tests as flaky:

```python
@pytest.mark.flaky(reruns=3, reruns_delay=1)
@pytest.mark.performance
def test_performance_threshold():
    """Test with relaxed thresholds for parallel execution."""
    # Use more lenient thresholds when running in parallel
    # to account for system load
    pass
```text

### 3. Serial Execution When Needed

Mark tests that must run serially:

```python
@pytest.mark.serial
def test_global_singleton():
    """Test that modifies global state unsafely."""
    pass
```

Then run serial tests separately:

```bash
# Run parallel-safe tests
pytest -n auto -m "not serial"

# Run serial tests sequentially
pytest -m serial
```text

### 4. Grouping Related Tests

Group tests that share resources:

```python
@pytest.mark.xdist_group(name="database")
class TestDatabaseOperations:
    def test_read(self):
        pass

    def test_write(self):
        pass
```

### 5. Avoiding Resource Conflicts

Use unique temporary directories:

```python
import tempfile
from pathlib import Path

@pytest.fixture
def temp_dir(tmp_path, worker_id):
    """Create worker-specific temporary directory."""
    if worker_id == "master":
        # Running sequentially
        return tmp_path

    # Running in parallel - create worker-specific dir
    return tmp_path / worker_id
```text

### 6. Benchmark Tests

Disable benchmarks in parallel execution:

Benchmarks are automatically disabled by pytest-benchmark when xdist is active.

To run benchmarks separately:

```bash
# Run non-benchmark tests in parallel
pytest -n auto -m "not benchmark"

# Run benchmarks sequentially
pytest -m benchmark --benchmark-only
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Tests Fail Only in Parallel

**Symptoms:** Tests pass sequentially but fail when run in parallel.

Causes:

1. Shared global state
2. File system conflicts (same temp files)
3. Port conflicts (hardcoded ports)
4. Race conditions

Solutions:

1. **Check for global state:**

   ```python
   # Use the auto_reset fixture
   @pytest.fixture(autouse=True)
   def reset_state(auto_reset):
       pass
   ```

2. **Use worker-specific resources:**

   ```python
   @pytest.fixture
   def port_number(worker_id):
       base_port = 8000
       if worker_id == "master":
           return base_port
       worker_num = int(worker_id.replace("gw", ""))
       return base_port + worker_num + 1
   ```

3. **Debug with single worker:**

   ```bash
   # Run with single worker to isolate issue
   pytest -n 1 -v
   ```

### Issue: Flaky Test Failures

**Symptoms:** Tests fail intermittently in parallel execution.

Solutions:

1. **Mark as flaky:**

   ```python
   @pytest.mark.flaky(reruns=3, reruns_delay=1)
   def test_timing_sensitive():
       pass
   ```

2. **Increase timeouts:**

   ```python
   @pytest.mark.timeout(60)  # Increase from 30
   def test_slow_operation():
       pass
   ```

3. **Relax thresholds:**

   ```python
   def test_performance():
       # Use more lenient threshold for parallel execution
       max_overhead = 0.50  # Instead of 0.10
       assert overhead < max_overhead
   ```

### Issue: Coverage Reports Incomplete

**Symptoms:** Coverage reports show missing data in parallel execution.

**Solution:** Use coverage's parallel mode:

```bash
# Run with coverage in parallel mode
pytest -n auto --cov=src --cov-report=term-missing

# Coverage is automatically configured for parallel execution
```text

### Issue: Slow Worker Scheduling

**Symptoms:** Some workers finish early while others are still running.

Solutions:

1. **Use loadscope distribution:**

   ```bash
   pytest -n auto --dist loadscope
   ```

2. **Group slow tests:**

   ```python
   @pytest.mark.xdist_group(name="slow_integration")
   class TestSlowIntegration:
       pass
   ```

### Issue: Worker Crashes

**Symptoms:** Workers crash with segmentation faults or memory errors.

Solutions:

1. **Reduce worker count:**

   ```bash
   pytest -n 4  # Instead of -n auto
   ```

2. **Increase memory limits:**

   ```bash
   ulimit -v unlimited
   pytest -n auto
   ```

3. **Run problematic tests serially:**

   ```python
   @pytest.mark.serial
   def test_memory_intensive():
       pass
   ```

## CI/CD Integration

### GitHub Actions

#### Basic Parallel Execution

```yaml
- name: Run tests in parallel
  run: |
    pytest tests/ \
      -n auto \
      -v \
      --tb=short \
      --cov=src \
      --cov-report=xml
```

#### Matrix Strategy with Parallel Execution

```yaml
strategy:
  matrix:
    python-version: ['3.11', '3.12', '3.13', '3.14']
    os: [ubuntu-latest, macos-latest, windows-latest]

steps:
  - name: Run unit tests
    run: |
      pytest tests/unit/ \
        -n auto \
        -v \
        --cov=src \
        --cov-report=xml
```text

#### Separate Parallel and Serial Jobs

```yaml
jobs:
  parallel-tests:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Run parallel-safe tests
        run: pytest -n auto -m "not serial and not slow"

  serial-tests:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Run serial tests
        run: pytest -m serial

  benchmark-tests:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Run benchmarks
        run: pytest -m benchmark --benchmark-only
```

### Local Development

#### Pre-Commit Hook

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# .git/hooks/pre-commit

# Run quick parallel tests before commit
pytest -n auto -m "smoke" --tb=short -q

if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    echo "Smoke tests failed. Commit aborted."
    exit 1
fi
```text

#### Development Workflow

```bash
# Quick feedback during development
pytest -n auto -m "unit" -x --tb=short

# Full test suite before PR
pytest -n auto -v --tb=short -m "not slow"

# Complete validation
pytest -n auto -v --cov=src --cov-report=html
```

---

## Known Limitations

### 1. Benchmark Tests

**Issue:** Benchmarks are incompatible with parallel execution.

**Impact:** Benchmark tests are automatically disabled when xdist is active.

**Workaround:** Run benchmarks separately:

```bash
pytest -m benchmark --benchmark-only
```text

### 2. Pytest-Randomly Interaction

**Issue:** Random seed is set per-worker, not globally.

**Impact:** Test order randomization may differ between workers.

**Workaround:** Use `--randomly-seed=<value>` for reproducibility:

```bash
pytest -n auto --randomly-seed=12345
```

### 3. Hypothesis Database

**Issue:** Hypothesis database writes may conflict between workers.

**Impact:** May see warnings about database conflicts.

**Workaround:** Set `HYPOTHESIS_DATABASE_FILE` to worker-specific paths.

### 4. Coverage Context

**Issue:** Coverage context is not preserved across workers.

**Impact:** May see "No contexts were measured" warning.

**Workaround:** This is cosmetic and does not affect coverage accuracy.

### 5. Resource-Intensive Tests

**Issue:** Running too many workers can overwhelm system resources.

**Impact:** Tests may fail due to resource exhaustion.

**Workaround:** Limit worker count:

```bash
pytest -n 4  # Use fixed worker count
```text

### 6. Fixture Scope

**Issue:** Session-scoped fixtures are created per-worker.

**Impact:** Increased memory usage and setup time.

**Workaround:** Use function or module scope when possible.

---

## Performance Tuning

### Optimal Worker Count

For the Repository Reporting System:

- **Development:** `-n 4` (balanced speed and resource usage)
- **CI/CD:** `-n auto` (maximize available resources)
- **Local Testing:** `-n 2` (preserve system responsiveness)

### Distribution Strategy Selection

| Test Suite Characteristics | Recommended Strategy |
| -------------------------- | -------------------- |
| Many small test files      | `loadfile` (default) |
| Few large test files       | `loadscope`          |
| Tests with shared fixtures | `loadgroup`          |
| Mixed                      | `loadfile`           |

### Memory Optimization

```bash
# Limit memory per worker
pytest -n 4 --maxfail=10 --tb=short
```
